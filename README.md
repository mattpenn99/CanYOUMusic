# UNLOCK THE FULL POTENTIAL OF YOUR MUSICAL MIND!

Can YOU Music? is a revolutionary music education platform for developing listening skills, designed to be playable by anyone regardless of musical experience.

Play levels, earn stars, challenge bosses and unlock featuresâ€”all while sharpening your listening skills underneath the hood.

## NO MUSICAL EXPERIENCE? NO PROBLEM!

Whether you are a professional musician, a total beginner, or somewhere in between, this game was made for you.

## WHY SHOULD I PLAY?

While the skills learned here are invaluable to a musician, they are also useful for anyone with even a remote interest in music of any kind.

If you have ever learned a new language, you know that even a cursory understanding of phonetic patterns and basic syntax can suddenly unlock a tremendous degree of perception. From what at first seems an indivisible string of random syllables, one quickly begins to discern where one word ends and another begins, and perhaps even to distinguish a noun from a verb or adjective.

This game teaches you what we consider the analogous principles as they pertain to the language of music, unlocking a whole world of insight that you might otherwise have never known existed.
